              Tokens or any digital currencies are not issued by any central
              banks or national, supra-national, or quasi-national
              organizations. They are also not backed by any hard assets or
              other credit. The value of tokens or any digital currencies is
              affected by several factors, including but not limited to, the
              total number of tokens or any digital currencies in existence, the
              continued willingness of market participants to exchange
              government-issued currency for tokens or digital currencies ,
              purchasers' expectations with respect to the rate of inflation of
              fiat currencies, purchasers' expectations with respect to the rate
              of deflation of cryptocurrencies, interest rates, currency
              exchange rates, cyber theft of cryptocurrencies from online
              digital wallet providers, or news of such theft from such
              providers or individuals' digital wallets, investment and trading
              activities of large investors, monetary policies of the
              governments, trade restrictions, currency devaluations and
              revaluations, regulatory measures, the global or regional
              political, economic or financial events and situations. Thus, all
              these factors will affect the value of a particular token or
              digital currency. No one will be obliged to guarantee the
              liquidity or the market price of any of the tokens or digital
              currencies maintained into your Wallet. The volatility and
              unpredictability of the value of tokens or digital currencies
              relative to the government-issued currency may result in a
              significant loss over a short period of time.

              We are unable to anticipate the occurrence of hacks, phishing,

              cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service errors,
              vulnerabilities, or defects in a timely manner and do not have

              are beyond our control. Although we have taken steps and used its
              best endeavour against malicious attacks on its appliances or its
              infrastructure, which are critical for the maintenance of the
              Platform and the Services, there can be no assurance that
              cyber-attacks, such as distributed denials of the Service, will
              not be attempted in the future, and that our enhanced security
              measures will be effective. Any significant breach of our security

              The Parties agree that subject to paragraph 17.1 above, any
              dispute, claim, or controversy between the Parties that arises in
              connection with, or relating in any way, to these Terms, or to
              your relationship with us as a user of the Services (whether by
              contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other
              legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the
              termination of these Terms) will be determined by a mandatory
              final and binding individual arbitration rather than a class
              action, except as set forth below under Exceptions to the
              Agreement to Arbitrate. The Parties further agree that the
              arbitrator will have the exclusive power to rule on his or her
              jurisdiction, including, without limitation, any objections with
              respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the Agreement to
              Arbitrate, or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.
              Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO
              JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION
              AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in
              court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the
              same damages and relief as a court, including, if applicable,
              attorney fees, except the arbitrator may not award declaratory or
              injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the
              arbitration. The arbitration provisions set forth in Clause 17
              will survive termination of these Terms.

              arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules. The seat
              of the arbitration shall be Majuro, Marshal Islands. The Tribunal

              shall be English.

              The existence of the arbitration, any non-public information
              provided in the arbitration, and any submissions, orders or awards
              made in the arbitration will not be disclosed to any non-parties

              witnesses, accountants and auditors, insurers and reinsurers, and
              any other person necessary to facilitate the arbitration.
              Notwithstanding the preceding, a party may disclose information to
              the extent that disclosure may be required to fulfil a legal duty,
              protect, or pursue a legal right, or enforce or challenge an award
              in bona fide legal proceedings. This confidentiality provision

              brought under these Terms.

                future changes to Section 17 regarding the parties' Agreement to
                Arbitrate, subject to applicable laws. You hereby consent and

                applicable laws, your continued use of your account will be
                interpreted as your acceptance of any modifications to Clause 17
                regarding the parties' Agreement to Arbitrate. You agree that if
                you object to the modifications to Clause 17, we may block
                access to your account pending closure of your account. In such
                circumstances, these Terms prior to modification will remain in
                full force and affect the pending closure of your

              The failure of one Party to require the performance of any
              provision will not affect that Party's right to require
              performance at any time thereafter. At the same time, the waiver
              of one Party to seek recovery for the other Party's violation of
              these Terms of any provisions of applicable terms will not
              constitute a waiver by that Party of any subsequent breach or
              violation by the other Party or of the provision itself.
